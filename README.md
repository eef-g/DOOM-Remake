### Build Instructions:
 This project uses CMake as the primary method of compiling and building. It includes a makefile in the root of the project to make the use of CMake streamlined and only a single command to build.

* __First time build__
```bash
  make setup
  make
```

* __Subsequent builds__
```bash
  make
```

__NOTE:__ If you wish to manually run the project after building, the game executable is located at build/game.exe
